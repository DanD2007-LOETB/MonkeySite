  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Marmosets are small New World monkeys, native to forests in South America, commonly fouind in the Amazon. They have claw like nails, rather  than flat 
     nails like most monkeys possess, which allows them to cling onto trees.</p>

  <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Marmosets commonly give birth to twins, which is highly uncommon for most monkey species. </li>
    <li> Many marmosets are colour blind, confusing reds and greens, and browns and oranges. </li>
    <li> Marmosets commonly eat sap from trees, which they get by puncturing holes in the bark with their teeth. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p>Marmosets live in tropical and subtropical forests across South America, from rainforests to more seasonal dry forest, scrub or 
	 coastal-forest zones depending on the species. Many species favour the forest canopy or understory, climbing and leaping among 
	 trees rather than spending time on the ground.</p>

  <h2>Diet</h2>
  <p> Many marmosets feed heavily on tree exudates such as gums, saps, and resins. They obtain these by gouging holes in bark with 
	  their enlarged, chisel-like incisors, making them among the most specialized gum-eating primates.</p>

  <h2>Behaviour</h2>
  <p>Marmosets use vocal, visual, tactile and scent communication: calls, scent-marking, grooming and body language help them 
	 coordinate group movement, signal danger or territory, and reinforce social bonds.</p>
