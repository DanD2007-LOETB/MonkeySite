  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p> Capuchins are one of the most intelligent monkeys. The "cap" in capuchin comes from the small part of their hair which resembles a cap.
      Their tails are usually the same length as their body. They are one of the smartest New World monkeys. With the species, the males are 
	  commonly larger than the females. They live in groups of 10, up to 35, and are commonly a social species. They are known as "Natures 
	  Tool Experts" due to them often using stones to break open nuts or shells, or leaves to scoop water from rivers.</p>

  <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> One of the top 10 most famous animal actors is a capuchin, knows as "Crystal the Monkey". </li>
    <li> While they can be seen as cute, they are not suited to be pets, due to them living in large groups, and needing lots of space to exercise. </li>
    <li> Capuchins are said to be in their own stone age, due to them using basic tools. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p> Capuchins can often be found in countries across Central and South America, most commonly in places such as, Costa Rica, Panama and Brazil. They can often be found 
	  in Manuel Antonio National Park, in the tree tops above. They are most often active during the early mornings and evenings where they can be seen playing and eating.</p>

  <h2>Diet</h2>
  <p> Like other monkey species, capuchins often eat various types of fruits and vegetables, which provide them with vitamins, minerals, fiber and hydration. Capuchins in captivity are primarily fed bananas, mangoes, papayas, 
	  carrots, cucumbers, bell peppers, etc. They require a lot of protein to support their muscle growth. Wild capuchins primarily eat insects, bird eggs, small reptiles and amphibions. Though they can eat cooked chicken and 
	  small portions of fish while kept in captivity.</p>

  <h2>Behaviour</h2>
  <p> One of the most notable behaviours of Capuchins, is the "Stone Age" they are currently going through. Many capuchins in Brazil's Serra da Capivara National Park 
	  have been found to use stones to break open seeds and nuts. This can be seen in the video attached below.  </p>
