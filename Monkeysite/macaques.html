  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Macaques are small monkeys, easily recognisable by their red faces. They are an omnivourous species usually eating fuits, leaves and seeds, but also insects and some small animals.
     Alothough their original habitat is in south-eastern countries, a few groups of them live in Florida in the wild. They are very popular on sites such as tiktok, as they can often be
	 very humourous. Attatched below is one of these monkeys, named xing xing, who has become infamous on sites such as tiktok and instagram.</p>

  <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Rhesus macaque are the most common species of macaque.</li>
    <li>They can often be found swimming, they do this to get food such as crabs and fish, but also for enrichment.</li>
    <li>Their scientific name is "Macaca mulatta"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p>Macaques are primarily found in Asian countries, such as India, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan. However they have also been found in florida, due to them being released onto a small island.
     The person who released them did not know they were good swimmers, which led to them swimming onto Florida. A lot of Macaques have grown used to living with humans, most commonly in India, 
	 where the Rhesus Macaque is considered a sacred animal by hindus.</p>

  <h2>Diet</h2>
  <p>Their diet consists of roots, various fruits, seeds, tree bark, and sometimes insects and smaller animals. Theyre also known to eat fish and crabs. Some of them can be found eating more processed
     foods due to tourists bringing them for the species to eat. This is very ill advised as the food can be harmful to them or even deadly. </p>

  <h2>Behaviour</h2>
  <p>They live in groups called "troops" which can be up to 200 of them. Even though they are very good climbers, they spend most of their time on the ground foraging and socialising. They can often be 
     found hanging around temples in countries such as China where there is lots of human activity, due to tourists often feeding the monkeys. However it is advised not to as they can be aggressive and
	 bite and attack humans if they are not fed. </p>
